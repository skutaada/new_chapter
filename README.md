# New Chapter

- 3 Model types:
    - LSTM
    - CNN
    - Dense

- 3 Model sizes:
    - LSTM (10 units, 50 units, 100 units)
    - CNN (Smaller, Medium, ResNet50 like)
    - Dense (Small , Medium, Large)

- 3 Input sizes:
    - LSTM (1 feature, 50 features, 100 features)
    - CNN (3x64x64, 3x112x112, 3x224x224)
    - Dense (10, 50, 100)

- Wide x Deep:
    - LSTM (one big LSTM ... multiple smaller LSTMs)
    - CNN (One convolution with many filters ... Multiple convs with few filters)
    - Dense (one big layer ... Multiple smaller layers)
